INSTALLATION

The default installation for gradebook2 is against Sakai trunk/2.7.x - to build against Sakai 2.6.x you will need to take the 
following actions:

(1) Run the sql script under client/src/sql/oracle/gb-datamodel-changes.sql against your sakai database (or set auto.ddl to true).
(2) Apply the patch sakai/2-6-x/gradebook.patch to the original gradebook module.
(3) Apply the patch sakai/2-6-x/sam.patch to the sam module.
(4) Check out this project as "gradebook2" and add it as a module under your sakai pom.xml for the active profile.
(5) Apply the patch sakai/2-6-x/gradebook2.patch to this directory
(6) Run setSakaiVersion.sh to update the Eclipse .classpath and maven pom.xml versions within the project
(7) Optional: Implement and deploy an InstitutionalAdvisor bean via Spring in Sakai components.


In other words, at your sakai base directory:
> svn co https://source.sakaiproject.org/contrib/gradebook2/trunk gradebook2
> cd gradebook2
> patch -p0 < sakai/2-6-x/gradebook2.patch
> cd ../gradebook
> patch -p0 < ../gradebook2/sakai/2-6-x/gradebook.patch
> cd ../sam
> patch -p0 < ../gradebook2/sakai/2-6-x/sam.patch
> cd ../
> vi pom.xml (and edit to include "gradebook2" as a module)
> cd gradebook2
> ./setSakaiVersion.sh
> mvn install sakai:deploy
