INSTALLATION

The default installation for gradebook2 is against Sakai trunk/2.7.x - to build against Sakai 2.5.x you will need to take the 
following actions:

(1) Run the sql script under client/src/sql/oracle/gb-datamodel-changes.sql against your sakai database (or set auto.ddl to true).
(2) Apply the patch sakai/2-5-x/gradebook.patch under the original gradebook module.
(3) Apply the patch sakai/2-5-x/sam.patch under the sam module.
(4) Check out this project as "gradebook2" and add it as a module under your sakai pom.xml for the active profile.
(5) Apply the patch sakai/2-5-x/gradebook2.patch under the gradebook2 module.
(6) Run setSakaiVersion.sh to set the Eclipse .classpath and maven pom.xml versions within the project.
(7) Optional: Implement and deploy an InstitutionalAdvisor bean via Spring under Sakai components.
