INSTALLATION

You will need to take the following actions:

(1) Run the sql script under client/src/sql/oracle/gb-datamodel-changes.sql against your sakai database (or set auto.ddl to true).
(2) Apply the patch sakai/2-5-x/gradebook.patch under the original gradebook module.
(3) Apply the patch sakai/2-5-x/sam.patch under the sam module.
(4) Check out this project as "gradebook2" and add it as a module under your sakai pom.xml for the active profile.
(5) Under your sakai profile in .m2/settings.xml set the <gwt.platform> tag to linux, mac, or windows (only tested on linux and mac so far).
(6) Optional: Configure Export Advisor by specifying which bean to inject. This is in the applicationContext.xml file via the placeholderConfig spring bean.


In other words, at your sakai base directory:
> svn co https://source.sakaiproject.org/contrib/gradebook2/tags/1.0.0 gradebook2
> cd gradebook
> patch -p0 < ../gradebook2/sakai/2-5-x/gradebook.patch
> cd ../sam
> patch -p0 < ../gradebook2/sakai/2-5-x/sam.patch
> cd ../
> vi pom.xml (and edit to include "gradebook2" as a module)
> cd gradebook2
> mvn install sakai:deploy
