INSTALLATION

You will need to take the following actions:

(1) Run the sql script under client/src/sql/oracle/sakai.sql against your sakai database (or set auto.ddl to true).
(2) Apply the patch sakai/trunk/edu-services.patch to the edu-services module and rebuild it. 
(3) Apply the patch sakai/trunk/sam.patch to the sam module.
(4) Check out this project as "gradebook2" and add it as a module under your sakai pom.xml for the active profile.
(5) Optional: Implement and deploy an InstitutionalAdvisor bean via Spring under Sakai components
