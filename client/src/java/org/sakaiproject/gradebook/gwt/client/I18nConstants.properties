	graded students. 

changingPointsRecalculatesGrades = Changing the max points value for an assignment will require any scores that have been previously entered for that \
	assignment to be recalculated. For example, if the value was 10 and is changed to 20, then a student score of 9 will become an 18. Note that reducing the \
	max points will result in a loss of grading precision due to the need for rounding.

	for a given item or a percentage score greater than 100 has been entered. For letter grades, an invalid \
	letter may have been entered. If all grades are shown as not accepted it's possible that you are attempting \
	to import a spreadsheet that was exported with a different grading scheme.
