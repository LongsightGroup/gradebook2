DEVELOPER BEST PRACTICES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a quick reference document for developer best practices when working on the 
Gradebook2 project.


1. Versioning

We made a decision fairly early on in the development of Gradebook2 that it should be 
versioned independently of Sakai releases. The basic thinking is that functionality within 
the GB2 codebase is going to change at a different rate than the Sakai APIs themselves, and 
that institutions that deploy GB2 will need to track their GB2 version independently, so for 
example if an institution upgrades from Sakai 2.5.5 to 2.6.2, they can (in theory) 
stick with version 1.2.0 of GB2. Perhaps more importantly, if an institution is committed
to staying at a particular Sakai release for some period, it will not be forced
to upgrade the overall release simply to get new functionality included in a later
version of the GB2 code. 

One major advantage of this is also that GB2 does not have to maintain maintenance branches.
Our recommendation is that in cases where a blocker bug exists in a particular version
of GB2, all institutions should upgrade to a version where that bug has been fixed.

The major disadvantage of this strategy is that we have to somehow deploy each release
for some reasonable set of supported versions of Sakai. The way we do that currently is
by maintaining patches in the sakai/ subdirectory of the project. So for example the 
current patch to make the trunk version compile against Sakai 2.6 can be found in
gradebook2/sakai/2-6-x/gradebook2.patch -- applying this patch and tweaking the minor
version number should produce a compatible release of GB2. 

Of course, any time we change the maven dependencies of the project, we also have to
update those existing gradebook2.patch files for each supported version.
