UPDATES FOR GRADEBOOK2 INSTALLERS

Mon, Nov 23, 2009
-----------------

We have established a plan for updating the edu-services data model in Sakai 2.7+ to remove 
the need for Gradebook2 installers to apply additional patches to Sakai. Unfortunately, this
means that institutions that have been running GB2 in versions prior to 1.2.x will need to 
run a database conversion script to update their DDLs as part of the move to 1.2.x, and 
backwards comptability patches for running against Sakai 2.5.x and 2.6.x will change as of
the 1.2.0 release of GB2 to be in keeping with the Sakai 2.7 data model.
