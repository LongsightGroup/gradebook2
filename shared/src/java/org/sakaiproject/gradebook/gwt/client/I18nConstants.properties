If you select "No," when the item's max points changes, all the item's existing scores will remain unchanged. This will change students' Course Grade; e.g., B- (80%) becomes C (75%).

changingPointsRecalculatesGrades = Changing the max points value for an item will require any scores that have been previously entered for that \
	item to be recalculated. For example, if the value was 10 and is changed to 20, then a student score of 9 will become an 18. Note that reducing the \
