doRecalculatePointsTitle = Do you want to scale any existing scores?
doRecalculatePointsMessage = Changing the max points value will impact scores for any student that \

	but all existing scores will keep their current value, resulting in a change in percentage score for all \
	graded students. 

changingPointsRecalculatesGrades = Changing the max points value for an assignment will require any scores that have been previously entered for that \
	assignment to be recalculated. For example, if the value was 10 and is changed to 20, then a student score of 9 will become an 18. Note that reducing the \
	max points will result in a loss of grading precision due to the need for rounding. 

confirmChangingWeightEquallyWeighted = This item is a member of a category that is set to equally weight its members. If you want to change the percent \
